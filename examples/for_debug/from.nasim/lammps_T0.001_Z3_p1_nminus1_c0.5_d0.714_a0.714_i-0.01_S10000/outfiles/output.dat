For help with the menu, type ./md_simulation_confined_ions -h
The default app simulates a total of 424 ions
MPI/OpenMP hybrid acceleration is built in this app
-----------------------------------------------------
Ions are confined by nanomaterial surfaces in aqueous solvent
Material surfaces modeled as thin planar interfaces
Solvent modeled as implicit media
Ions modeled as finite-size, soft spheres

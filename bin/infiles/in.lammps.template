# MD Simulation of Confined Electrolyte #
# The LAMMPS input script enables simulations of ions confined between nanoparticles (NPs) or other material surfaces;
# The script contains "read data" command which defines the model to be simulated; The model is generated by C++ code in Github (https://softmaterialslab.github.io/nanoconfinement-md/);
# The surfaces at z = âˆ’l/2 to z = l/2 are treated as unpolarized planar walls. The ion interact with walls directly;
# Length of confinement is of the order of nanometers;
# Coulombic interactions are calculated by 3D Ewald method; (charged sheets method is applied in nanoconfinement-md code);
# Users can extract the ionic structure (density profile) for a wide variety of ionic and environmental parameters;
# Input Pararmeters in Simulation #
# Note that for style lj, all quantities are in reduced LJ units;
# All ions have identical sizes;
# Mass of positive ion = Mass of chlorine ion;
# Unit of length = Diameter of positive ion =  Diameter of negative ion;
# Positive charge = 1 e; Negative charge = -1 e;
# lx = ly and periodic boundary; lz is nonperiodic boundary;
# epsilon_water = 80;
# room_temperature = 298 in Kelvin;
# cutoff for LJ interactions = 2 ^ (1/6) = 1.122462048 (in reduced lj unit);

"delay" means never build new lists until at least N steps after the previous build. "every" means build lists every M steps. check = yes, then every and delay settings determine when a build may possibly be performed;

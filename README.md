What does this code do
* The code enables simulations of ions confined between nanoparticles (NPs) or other material surfaces
    * Length of confinement is of the order of nanometers
* Materials represent nanoparticles (NPs) or biomacromolecules
    * NP surfaces are treated as planar walls due to the large size difference between ions and NPs 
* Users can extract the ionic structure (density profile) for a wide variety of ionic and environmental parameters
* Unpolarized surfaces are assumed and standard molecular dynamics is used to propagrate the dynamics of ions
